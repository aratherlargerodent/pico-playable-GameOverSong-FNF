# you died lmao
Pico's "Game Over" track, but it's playable.
I was goofing around with the chart editor and this is the result, I hope you like it! It's a very simple and short mod with one song, and yet it took me about three days to make.

Someone's probably already made this lol, I haven't checked



Also, I hate those cans Darnell kicks, adding them took a stupidly long time to figure out. 
First they weren't appearing at all, and that took me days to figure out. 
Then, once I finally managed to stitch some code together to actually make the things appear (i just copied it from 2hot lmao),
they wouldn't explode midair. I'm not exactly sure _how_ I fixed that, it just kinda worked itself out lol

I got the mod template from here: https://gamebanana.com/tools/16833
