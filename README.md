# you died lmao

(Writing this on 2/4/2026, this mod is NOT good, DO NOT play it if you value quality)

Pico's "Game Over" track, but it's playable.

I was goofing around with the chart editor and this is the result, I hope you like it! It's a very simple and short mod with one song, and yet it took me about three days to make.

Someone's probably already made this lol, I haven't checked

I got the mod template from here: https://gamebanana.com/tools/16833

Check the "Releases" in the bottom right-ish area of the repo to find the mod, or you could just download it from the file up there i guess that's cool too

Known Issues are in the "Issues" tab on the top toolbar.

Also, I hate those cans Darnell kicks, adding them took a stupidly long time to figure out. 
First they weren't appearing at all, and that took me days to sort out. 
Then, once I finally managed to stitch some code together to actually make the things appear (i just copied it from 2hot lmao),
they wouldn't explode midair. I'm not exactly sure _how_ I fixed that, it just kinda worked itself out lol

But on TOP of all of that, the stupid cans cause LAG when Darnell kicks the first one, and I don't think I can fix that. F in the chat
